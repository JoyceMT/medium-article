      <h3>Isla Holbox, Quintana Roo</h2>
      <p>
        A relatively undiscovered island in the state of Quintana Roo is Isla Holbox. Although it has numerous beaches, its tiny size warrants its inclusion here as a singular entity. Having long been famous with divers for the unrivaled presences of whale sharks, it is now gaining popularity in the traveler community for its relaxing ambiance, shallow waters, and practically deserted virgin beaches. Go there soon to truly get a feel for Holbox, or the tourists will have arrived en masse and commercialized everything.

      <h3>Bahia Balandra, La Paz, Baja California Sur</h2>
      <p>
        La Paz is a favorite of holiday makers and so it makes sense that one of the beaches in that region would be amongst the most beautiful in the whole country. Bahia Balandra is a serene, shallow water piece of the Mexican coastline, making it perfect for kids and those who are not great at swimming. Azure toned water teems with tropical, colorful fish that can easily be seen with a simple snorkel. Get there early to make the most of the sprawling surroundings before people start arriving.
